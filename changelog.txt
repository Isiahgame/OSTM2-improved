OSTM2 - CHANGELOG

---=== v0.0.6 - June 24 2015 ===---
* New UI layout
    - One screen is visible at a time
    - Header tabs have been moved to the left
    - Moved Equipment into Inventory menu
    - Currency is visible in town! Inventory is not.
    - Still lots of work to do here; a lot of flows are sub-good
* Rebirth is available in towns after level 50
    - Rebirth gives additional skill points, separate from current level
    - You lose all levels, passives, items, and gold
    - You keep gems and uncovered map areas
* Enemies gain their own passive stats as they level. They're hopefully much much harder now.

---=== v0.0.5a - June 13 2015 ===---
. Bugfix: Enemies no longer receive bonuses from the player's passive skills :D

---=== v0.0.5 - June 13 2015 ===---
* Redo sword and dagger art

. Some affix tweaks
. Some performance improvements

---=== v0.0.4 - June 11 2015 ===---
* Add Jewel item slot
  - Jewels have secondary stats, like bonus XP and item rarity bonuses
* Level-appropriate items are more likely to drop
* Weapons have different images for different tiers
* Shop items are always at least Magic
* Equipment is moved to its own subscreen
* Items show how they change calculated player Power on equip
  - Items that would be an upgrade show a green dot in the inventory and in shops
  - Note: this doesn't always guarantee increased combat effectiveness;
    health regen for example isn't included in Power calculations
. Bugfix: Base crit rating on items works now
. Bugfix: Fix some cases of item dialog boxes not disappearing
