Classes

Purpose
    The class system lets players build up a character and carve out an identity, that persists across rebirths.

Summary
    The player character can choose what class to play as. Each class has its own stat modifiers, passive skill tree, and learnable active skills.

Rebirth
    Changing from class A to class B will reset the player's current level to 1.
