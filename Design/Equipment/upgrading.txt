Item Upgrading

Philosophy
    A player should be able to invest in an item and enhance its power, but upgrading one item shouldn't invalidate finding new items.

    - Upgrading an item costs gold in proportion to the rarity of the item, the item's level, and the item's material.
    - The item's material doesn't change. Magic affixes on the item stay the same. Enchantments the player can put on the item stay at the level the item was found at.
    - The only thing that increases are the base stats of the item, in the same way an item normally levels up (at 80% effectiveness, so a 'level X sword +X' won't be as effective as a 'level 2X sword').
    - Required level does not increase.
