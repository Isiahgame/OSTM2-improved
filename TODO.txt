Todo for 0.0.2 release:
- better map level divvying (linear increase heading out)
- 2 ring slots! (item button refactor)
- update notif tech? (notification to refresh when update pushed)


------------- OLD: pre-5/24/15, audit later


Current Big Problem: game is boring at start

Why: no meaningful interaction/decision making

Solutions:
    - manual-spawn enemy w/ click
        - find Hunter early on who teaches you autobattle
        - OR early adventurer skill is autobattle; lets you invest in reducing autobattle timer early
    - skill tree asap
    - town w/ gear options

---

Map
- discover connections, not nodes
- center view on start node
- towns

Battle
- more-real stat scaling
- Skill trees
- abilities

Items
- Upgrading
- Enchanting

Overall
- screen switching architecture
- htmlrenderer improvements
    - %-based pos (i.e., left 25%)
    - anchor point (center, topleft; set by vec2)

Refactors
- MapGenerator <-> MapNode separation of concerns

Engine
- Singleton class w/ autobuild macro

---

Ideas:

- Adventurer class is starting class
    - passives are general-purpose improvements
    - one passive is "other classes have their passives improved by X% when active"
- armor gives flat EHP multiplier per point
    - EHP increase per point of armor is more effective at lower levels
    - level scaling is based on attacker's level, i.e. you don't get weaker when leveling up, ever
